## Abstract

This bachelor thesis presents the implementation and evaluation of quantum error correction (QEC) codes within the Qibo quantum computing framework. Quantum error correction is essential for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, as quantum states are inherently fragile and susceptible to decoherence and operational errors. This project focuses on implementing various QEC schemes in Qibo, including stabilizer codes, surface codes, and repetition codes, while evaluating their performance under different noise models.

The implementation provides a comprehensive library of quantum error correction tools that integrate seamlessly with Qibo's existing quantum circuit simulation capabilities. Performance benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of different error correction strategies, and the modular design allows for easy extension to additional QEC protocols.

**Keywords:** Quantum Error Correction, Qibo, Quantum Computing, Stabilizer Codes, Surface Codes, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing

## Introduction

### Motivation

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize computational capabilities, offering exponential speedups for specific problems such as factoring large integers, simulating quantum systems, and solving optimization problems. However, quantum systems are extremely fragile, with quantum states being susceptible to decoherence from environmental interactions and errors from imperfect quantum operations.

Quantum error correction (QEC) represents a fundamental solution to this challenge, enabling the protection of quantum information through redundant encoding and active error detection and correction. The development of practical QEC implementations is crucial for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.

### Objectives

This thesis aims to:

1. **Implement** various quantum error correction codes within the Qibo framework
2. **Evaluate** the performance of different QEC schemes under realistic noise models
3. **Develop** a modular and extensible QEC library for the quantum computing community
4. **Analyze** the trade-offs between different error correction strategies
5. **Provide** comprehensive documentation and examples for practical use

### Scope and Limitations

This project focuses on:
- Implementation of stabilizer codes (including Steane code, Shor code)
- Surface code implementation and topological error correction
- Repetition codes for bit-flip and phase-flip errors
- Integration with Qibo's quantum circuit simulation
- Performance evaluation under various noise models

Limitations include:
- Focus on stabilizer codes (non-stabilizer codes are not covered)
- Simulation-based evaluation (no hardware implementation)
- Classical processing of syndrome decoding

## Literature Review and Background

### Quantum Error Correction Theory

Quantum error correction builds upon classical error correction theory but faces unique challenges due to the quantum nature of information:

1. **No-cloning theorem**: Quantum states cannot be perfectly copied, preventing direct redundancy approaches
2. **Measurement destroys superposition**: Direct measurement of quantum states for error detection destroys the quantum information
3. **Continuous error space**: Quantum errors can be arbitrary rotations, not just discrete bit flips

#### Key Concepts

- **Quantum Error Correction Conditions**: The necessary and sufficient conditions for correctable errors
- **Stabilizer Formalism**: A mathematical framework for describing quantum error correction codes
- **Syndrome Extraction**: The process of measuring error syndromes without disturbing the encoded information
- **Logical Operations**: Performing quantum gates on encoded logical qubits

### Previous Work

#### Classical Error Correction
- Hamming codes and their quantum analogues
- Reed-Solomon codes and their quantum extensions
- Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes

#### Quantum Error Correction
- **Shor's 9-qubit code** (1995): The first quantum error correction code
- **Steane's 7-qubit code** (1996): More efficient stabilizer code
- **Surface codes** (1997-present): Topological codes with high threshold
- **Color codes**: Alternative topological approach

### Qibo Framework

Qibo is an open-source quantum computing framework that provides:
- Efficient quantum circuit simulation
- Support for various quantum hardware backends
- Extensible architecture for custom quantum algorithms

### Core Components

#### 1. Stabilizer Code Base Class

```python
class StabilizerCode:
    """Base class for stabilizer quantum error correction codes."""
    
    def __init__(self, stabilizers, logicals=None):
        self.stabilizers = stabilizers
        self.logicals = logicals
        self.n_qubits = len(stabilizers[0])
        self.n_stabilizers = len(stabilizers)
        
    def encode(self, logical_state):
        """Encode logical qubit(s) into physical qubits."""
        pass
        
    def syndrome_extraction(self, circuit):
        """Extract error syndrome without disturbing logical information."""
        pass
        
    def decode(self, syndrome):
        """Decode syndrome to determine error correction."""
        pass
```

#### 2. Steane Code Implementation

The 7-qubit Steane code corrects any single-qubit error using 7 physical qubits to encode 1 logical qubit.

#### 3. Surface Code Implementation

Surface codes are topological quantum error correction codes that are particularly promising for practical quantum computing due to their:
- High error threshold (~1%)
- Local interactions only
- Scalable architecture

#### 4. Syndrome Decoders

Multiple decoding strategies are implemented:
- **Perfect decoder**: Assumes perfect syndrome measurement
- **Lookup table decoder**: Pre-computed correction for all syndromes
- **Minimum weight decoder**: Finds minimum weight error consistent with syndrome
- **ML-based decoder**: Neural network-based decoding

### Integration with Qibo

The implementation leverages Qibo's features:

```python
import qibo
from qibo import Circuit, gates
from qibo_error_correction import SteaneCode

# Create logical Bell state
code = SteaneCode()
circuit = Circuit(14)  # 7 qubits × 2 logical qubits
circuit.add(code.encode_logical_bell_state())

# Add noise
circuit.add(gates.X(0).controlled_by())  # Simulated error

# Syndrome extraction and correction
syndromes = code.extract_syndromes(circuit)
corrections = code.decode(syndromes)
circuit.add(corrections)
```
